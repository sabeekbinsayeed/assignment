                <p>The expert cooking and balance of spices makes it scrumptious with every single bite. Everything just
                    hits the taste buds perfectly and goes really well with their in-house naan, which is complemented
                    with the salad on the sides.


                    It's a perfect place for a dinner date or even a gathering. You can also order for parties or events
                    with catering. If you are craving for some traditional or exotic food, with a touch of the Indian
                    culture, Tarka is the place to go.</p>
